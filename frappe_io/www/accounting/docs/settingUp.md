## Setting Up

When you open Frappe Accounting for the first time, you'll be greeted with the Setup Wizard.

##### Setting Up Country:
The first slide sets up the country you are based in. The Chart of Accounts (COA) will be bootstrapped for you depending upon the country that is chosen.
Select your country from the drop-down provided and then click on next.

##### Setting Up Company information:
The third slide sets up the Company information. The Company Name will become the name of your database file. For e.g, if you select `TennisMart` as your Company Name then the application will make `tennisMart.db` as your database file which will be stored in the folder you selected in the first slide.

Type the name of your Company and the name of your Bank. Enter the start date and the end date of the fiscal year from the calender provided.
